  volume = {102627},
  shorttitle = {Skills for work in {Bulgaria}},
  abstract = {Bulgaria is undergoing both a rapid demographic transition and a significant structural shift in its economy. Increasing longevity combined with low fertility and emigration have made Bulgaria’s age structure increasingly top-heavy and its dependency ratios higher. At the same time, the economic sectors that absorbed low-skilled workers during the high-growth early 2000s, such as construction and manufacturing, were those that contracted most during the 2008–09 economic crisis and they have not yet recovered. Meanwhile, activities demanding high-skilled labor, such as financial and business services and information, communication, and technology (ICT), have been faring relatively well. This study uses a new dataset with direct measures of cognitive and socio-emotional skills to examine the relationship between skills and labor market outcomes in Bulgaria. For a long time, labor market studies had to rely on formal educational attainment as a measure of an individual’s skills. However, the correlation between formal education and skills is not perfect, and not all diplomas are equal in terms of imparting certain skills to students. Moreover, valuable skills can be acquired without formal diplomas, for example through on-the-job training or learning-by doing. In addition to using educational attainment this study therefore looks at direct measures of two types of skills that employer’s value: cognitive skills, such as functional literacy and numeracy, and socio-emotional skills, such as self-discipline, perseverance, and ability to work well with others. The objective is to assess the extent to which these direct measures shed light on what matters for labor market success, defined as being in the labor force, being employed, and earning more. This analysis relies on original data (the Bulgarian Longitudinal Inclusive Society Survey, BLISS) collected by the World Bank and Open Society Institute–Sofia in the spring of 2013, which for the first time in the country included nationally-representative information on the cognitive and socio-emotional skills of the working-age population.},

  abstract = {A collection of essays on a wide range of aspects of the Roma communities, cultures, social and political conditions across Europe. The scholarly field of Romany studies is trapped by the history of Roma in a unique and peculiar position in Europe. The investigation of Roma was in the past marginal to academic concerns because most of its practitioners were amateur folklorists interested in treating the Roma as paragons of a lost world and not as citizens of modern nation-states. Today the field is hemmed in by two different power fields: the emotionally understandable, though intellectually debilitating, concern to turn the plight of the Roma into a matter of human rights and the difficulty that academics experience in dealing with people who are not a people in the sense that nation states constitute and make peoples.

Differences in education are the most important factor behind the gap, the number of children is important for female employment and geographic differences play little role once education is controlled for. Conditional on employment, the gap in log earnings is 0.3, and half of it is explained by educational differences.},

The first part of the paper is focused on data, correlating unequal educational opportunities and the ethnicity factor. The text presents an insight into the widely argued Roma dropout phenomenon. Different sets of reasons for dropping out from school are being discussed, i.e. educational, ethnic and cultural, economic, and family reasons. In addition, the article reflects on the retrograde beliefs of the majority population as a prerequisite for Roma reluctance towards continuing education. Moreover, the article puts forward a review on the most recent key policy measures for equal educational opportunities, targeting the Roma. Various aspects of adopted policy interventions for stimulating educational inclusion are illustrated, and supplemented by a critical analysis. The authors conclude that the required strategic actions, targeting educational equity for marginalized social groups, such as the Roma, have been indeed formulated by the stakeholders; yet, certain shortcomings have been noticed and these are primarily linked to the practical implementation of the national documents into real actions.},

Over the last few years, they have attracted unprecedented attention with the fear of massive waves of emigrants to Western European countries. Using unique comparative data from 12 Central and South-East European countries, we study the pattern and determinants of Roma emigration intentions. We find that plans to go abroad are more frequent among Roma compared to non-Roma, but the ethnic gap in emigration intentions is not explained by the more disadvantaged characteristics of Roma compared to non-Roma. Among the Roma population, potential emigrants are more educated and wealthier on average. Finally, ethnic discrimination is a very influential factor that explains the intentions to emigrate within the Roma population.},
